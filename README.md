# Topics in Social Data Science

This is the GitHub page for the course [Topics in Social Data Science](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08371u/2018-2019).

In this course, GitHub is only used to host files (exercises and assignments, mainly) and describe the course (see [wiki](https://github.com/abjer/tsds/wiki)). To access the files go ahead and:

1. Fire up a terminal/console on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in your computer where you keep the folder for this course
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/abjer/tsds`

Now you have all the course files on your computer. When we update the course material (and we do every now and then) you can get the newest version of all the files by running `git pull origin master` from inside the course folder. We recommend you get used to doing this before every class session, so that you don't solve outdated exercises.

**Important**: Do ***not*** edit the files that you pull from this Github repository. Because we update them every now and then, changes you make will potentially be overwritten and lost. Instead, copy the exercise and assignment notebooks out of the git directory and into another directory where you can start filling them out with solutions. 

Note that you can also fork this repo. This allows you to propose changes to this repo or keep your own version of the repo with your own modifications. See more [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
